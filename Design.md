Build calculations with python
Use NACA Airfoils

Calculate top profile line for a given length of that line.

Calculate points for different desired profiles.
Calculate the location for every 1/10th distance along that line.

join the dots for each 1/10th point from one profile to the next
This will create a curved line.

Then find the center point that draws that curve.

To calculate the 1/10 point
sum the distances from each point to the next until it exceeds the 1/10 distance.




Visualise optimisations with matlibplot

Drive design formulas and parameters in fusion 360 with outputs from calculations above.
